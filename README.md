## About The Project

Welcome to Shadowystupidcoders Dumb Raydium Utilitys Demo Repo. 

This collection of utilities is designed to interact with the Raydium protocol on the Solana blockchain. The utilities are built with a focus on outsmarting and outsniping bots on Solana, providing you with a competitive edge in the DeFi space.

What's Inside?
The repository contains a variety of utilities, each serving a unique purpose. Here's a brief overview of some of the utilities included:

Monitor and remove liquidity (fast) all via terminal, just type the magic word.

Fetch all pool keys from a single market ID

Swap in and out in the same block w/ 2 wallets to generate artificial volume on the dexes with 0 risk of being sniped etc. using jito bundles. 

Things not shown:

Initialize and swap with multiple wallets

Create market for 0.3

The most lightweight efficient sniper you've ever seen (about 150 lines of code using just solana web3). Monitor LP burns, ignore the pools that swap their own supply, etc etc.

Bundlers, jito, swap same tx init, literally everything.

For a small fee, you can gain access to the full repository, which includes all the utilities and future updates plus near 24/7 support and unlimited questions. You are welcome to spam me all day and night with any Solana developer questions and I might  be able to help you with one or two of them.
